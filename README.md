### Simple, robust, blazing-fast YouTube Player API

## Install

```
npm install yt-player
```

## Why this package?

Most of the existing YouTube API packages on npm are incomplete or overcomplicated.

Note: It is irresponsible to publish a package that requires all of
`babel-runtime`, `lodash`, and 20KB of other nonsense to do a simple task. Using
fancy dependencies doesn't make you a better programmer, and it's certainly not a
"best practice" to ship tons of extra code to your website visitors. Less is more.

## Features

  - Powered by the [YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)
  - Lightweight - only 3.14kb gzipped and minified!
  - Extremely fast time-to-first-frame
    - YouTube IFrame API `<script>` is automatically loaded on first use
    - For even faster start time, add `<script src='https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api' async></script>` to your page
    - Automatically detects the presence of the API `<script>` so API is never loaded twice
  - API commands are automatically queued (until both the Iframe API and Player instance are ready)
  - Differentiate between *fatal* errors and *unplayable video* errors
  - Adds the all-important 'timeupdate' event, which the YouTube API lacks
  - Well-commented codebase makes it easy to understand what's going on
  - No promises, babel, async-await, large runtime dependencies, or pointless code
  - Note: no support for old browsers (e.g. IE11 and below)

## Usage

```js
const YTPlayer = require('yt-player')
const player = new YTPlayer('#player')

player.load('GKSRyLdjsPA')
player.setVolume(100)

player.on('playing', () => {
  console.log(player.getDuration()) // => 351.521
})
```

## API

### `player = new Player(element, [opts])`

Create a new YouTube player. The player will take the place of the HTML element
`element`. Alternatively, `element` can be a selector string, which will be passed
to `document.querySelector()`.

Examples: `#player`, `.youtube-player`, or a DOM node.

Optionally, provide an options object `opts` to customize the player.

#### `opts.width` (number)

This parameter indicates the width of the player.

#### `opts.height` (number)

This parameter indicates the height of the player.

#### `opts.autoplay` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the initial video will automatically start to play
when the player loads. The default value is `false`.

#### `opts.captions` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether closed captions should be shown, even if the user
has turned captions off. The default behavior is based on user preference.

#### `opts.controls` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the video player controls are displayed. The
default value is `true`.

#### `opts.keyboard` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the player will respond to keyboard shortcuts. The
default value is `true`.

#### `opts.fullscreen` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the player will show a fullscreen button. The
default value is `true`.

#### `opts.annotations` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the player will show video annotations. The
default value is `true`.

#### `opts.modestBranding` (boolean)

This parameter lets you use a YouTube player that does not show a YouTube logo.
Even when this option is enabled, a small YouTube text label will still display in
the upper-right corner of a paused video when the user's mouse pointer hovers over
the player. The default value is `false`.

#### `opts.related` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the player should show related videos when
playback of the initial video ends. The default value is `true`.

#### `opts.info` (boolean)

This parameter indicates whether the player should display information like the
video title and uploader before the video starts playing. The default value is
`true`.

#### `opts.timeupdateFrequency` (number)

The time between `onTimeupdate` callbacks, in milliseconds. Default is `1000`.

See:
[`YT.Player` parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Loading_a_Video_Player)
and
[`playerVars` parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters)
for additional documentation about these parameters.

### `player.load(videoId, [autoplay])`

This function loads the specified `videoId`. An example of a `videoId` is
`'GKSRyLdjsPA'`.

Optionally, specify an `autoplay` parameter to indicate whether the video should
begin playing immediately, or wait for a call to `player.play()`. Default is
`true`.

This should be the first function called on a new `Player` instance.

### `player.play()`

Plays the currently loaded video.

### `player.pause()`

Pauses the currently playing video.

### `player.stop()`

Stops and cancels loading of the current video. This function should be reserved
for rare situations when you know that the user will not be watching additional
video in the player. If your intent is to pause the video, you should just call
`pause()`. If you want to change the video that the player is playing,
you can call `load()` without calling `stop()` first.

### `player.seek(seconds)`

Seeks to a specified time in the video. If the player is paused when the function
is called, it will remain paused. If the function is called from another state
(playing, video cued, etc.), the player will play the video. The player will
advance to the closest keyframe before that time unless the player has already
downloaded the portion of the video to which the user is seeking.

### `player.setVolume(volume)`

Sets the volume. Accepts an integer between `0` and `100`.

### `player.mute()`

Mutes the player.

### `player.unMute()`

Unmutes the player.

### `player.setPlaybackRate(rate)`

This function sets the suggested playback rate for the current video. If the
playback rate changes, it will only change for the video that is already being
played. Calling `load()` will reset the playback rate to 1.

### `player.getVolume()`

Returns the player's current volume, an integer between `0` and `100`. Note that
`getVolume()` will return the volume even if the player is muted.

### `player.isMuted()`

Returns true if the player is muted, false if not.

### `player.getPlaybackRate()`

This function retrieves the playback rate of the currently playing video. The
default playback rate is `1`, which indicates that the video is playing at normal
speed. Playback rates may include values like `0.25`, `0.5`, `1`, `1.5`, and `2`.

### `player.getAvailablePlaybackRates()`

This function returns the set of playback rates in which the current video is
available. The default value is `1`, which indicates that the video is playing in
normal speed.

The function returns an array of numbers ordered from slowest to fastest playback
speed. Even if the player does not support variable playback speeds, the array
should always contain at least one value (`1`).

### `player.getDuration()`

Returns the duration in seconds of the currently playing video. Note that
`getDuration()` will return 0 until the video's metadata is loaded, which normally
happens just after the video starts playing.

### `player.getProgress()`

Returns a number between `0` and `1` that specifies the percentage of the video
that the player shows as buffered.

### `player.getState()`

Returns the state of the player. Possible values are: `'unstarted'`, `'ended'`,
`'playing'`, `'paused'`, `'buffering'`, or `'cued'`.

### `player.getCurrentTime()`

Returns the elapsed time in seconds since the video started playing.

### `player.destroy()`

Removes the `<iframe>` containing the player and cleans up all resources.

### `player.destroyed` (boolean)

Returns `true` if the player if `destroy()` has been called on the player.

### `player.videoId` (string)

Returns the currently loaded video ID, i.e. what was passed to `load()`.

### `player.on('error', (err) => {})`

This event fires if a fatal error occurs in the player. This does not include
videos that fail to play, for whatever reason.

### `player.on('unplayable', (videoId) => {})`

This event fires if the YouTube player cannot play the given video. This is not a
fatal error. This event is reported separately from the `'error'` event so
there is an opportunity to play another video gracefully.

Possible reasons for this error:

- The video requested was not found. This error occurs when a video has been
  removed (for any reason) or has been marked as private.

- The owner of the requested video does not allow it to be played in embedded
  players.

- The request contains an invalid parameter value. For example, this error occurs
  if you specify a videoId that does not have 11 characters, or if the videoId contains invalid characters, such as exclamation points or asterisks.

### `player.on('timeupdate', (seconds) => {})`

This event fires when the time indicated by the `getCurrentTime()` method has been
updated.

### `player.on('unstarted', () => {})`
### `player.on('ended', () => {})`
### `player.on('playing', () => {})`
### `player.on('paused', () => {})`
### `player.on('buffering', () => {})`
### `player.on('cued', () => {})`

These events fire when the player enters the respective state. These event names
are the same as the possible return values from `player.getState()`.

### `player.on('playbackQualityChange', (quality) => {})`

This event fires whenever the video playback quality changes. Possible
values are: 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'hd720', 'hd1080', 'highres'.

### `player.on('playbackRateChange', (playbackRate) => {})`

This event fires whenever the video playback rate changes.

### `player.on('ready', () => {})`

This event fires when the YouTube API calls it's own onReady.  
This is better than the `unstarted` event, since `unstarted` happens before `ready`, and the `_ready` state must be true to perform any other tasks.
